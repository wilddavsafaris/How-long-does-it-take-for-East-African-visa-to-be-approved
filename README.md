How long does it take for East African visa to be approved?
How long does it take for East African visa to be approved? The East Africa visa is a travel permit issued to travelers exploring Uganda, Rwanda, and Kenya during safaris (gorilla trekking safaris, chimpanzee trekking safaris, Kenya trekking safaris and Uganda birding safaris among others). This joint visa allows seamless travel between these three countries. It costs 100 USD per person and can be paid for using various methods such as visa cards, MasterCard, credit cards, or bank payments during the application process. The visa is valid for 90 days and allows for multiple entries into the mentioned countries.
If for example you desire gorilla trekking safaris, to obtain the East Africa visa, you can apply online or through the respective immigration authorities in Uganda, Kenya, or Rwanda. The processing time is typically 2 to 3 days. Each country has its own specific requirements for the visa application, but generally, a valid passport, passport-sized photograph, yellow fever vaccination certificate, return ticket, and travel itinerary are necessary.
In Kenya, a recent presidential directive has introduced the electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) for tourists visiting the country, with certain exemptions for specific individuals and transit passengers. Meanwhile, Rwanda offers a visa waiver for various countries, including those within the East African Community, and provides visas on arrival at Kigali International Airport and all land borders.
It's important to note that the East Africa visa does not cover all East African countries, as it is specifically for Uganda, Rwanda, and Kenya. Therefore, travelers visiting other East African nations such as Burundi and Tanzania will need to obtain separate visas for those countries.
The processing time for an East Africa tourist visa can vary depending on the country you are applying to. However, in general, it is recommended to apply for the visa at least a few weeks in advance to allow for processing time. This can also apply for other businesses such as gorilla trekking safaris, chimpanzee trekking safaris, Uganda birding safaris, Kenya hiking safaris.
For example, the processing time for the East Africa tourist visa for Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda can range from a few days to a couple of weeks, depending on the specific circumstances and the method of application (online or through an embassy/consulate).
It's important to check the official government websites of the respective countries for the most up-to-date information on visa processing times and requirements. Additionally, it's always a good idea to apply for the visa well in advance of your planned travel dates to avoid any last-minute issues.
